1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

     HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and it is used in client-server communication. 
   By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.

   HTTP1.1:

   -> It works on the textual format.
   -> There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
   -> It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
   -> It compresses data by itself.

   HTTP2:

   -> It works on the binary protocol.
   -> It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
   -> It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
   -> It uses HPACK for data compression.
   

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

    Objects is the most important data-type in javascript and forms the building blocks of elements. Objects are quite different from Javascript's
   Primitive data-types(Number, Boolean, String, Undefined, Null and symbols). Depending on there types of primitive data-types all store single value.
   
     objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
   These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
     
   Creating Objects in JavaScript:
    -> By object literal
    -> By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
	
   By object literal:
     . Property and value is separated by colon(:).
	 
	 Syntax:
	   object={property1:value1,property2:value2,.......,propertyN:valueN}

     Example1:
	   var person={
	        firstName="sanjith",
	        lastName="kumar",
		age=25
		};


   By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
     . Here, new keyword is used to create object.
	 
	 Syntax:
	   var objectName=new object();

     Example2:
	   var emp=new object();
	         emp.Id=100;
		 emp.name="sanjith";
		 emp.age=25;


   Accessing JavaScript Objects:
     The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

         objectName.property
                 or
         objectName[“property”]

   Accessing ‘fistName’ from example1 using dot operator,
         person.firstName

   Accessing ‘name’ form example2 using [],
         emp["name"]
